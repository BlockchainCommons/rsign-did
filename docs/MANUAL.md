# Manual

This document describes how to use `torgap-sig-cli-rust` and how to export and use `minisign` keys
in a Tor onion v3 hidden service.

All signatures produced by `torgap-sig-cli-rust` can be verified with `minisign` including trusted comments.

And `minisign` is able to sign files with keys generated by `torgap-sig-cli-rust`.

`torgap-sig-cli-rust` is a command-line interface. It relies on the [torgap-sig crate](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap-sig), that can be embedded in any application.

## Usage

Generate a new key pair:

```sh
rsign generate
```
The public key is printed in the screen and stored in `rsign.pub` by default. The secret key will be written at `~/.rsign/rsign.key`. You can change the default paths with `-p` and `-s` respectively.
If you want to generate keys from a deterministic seed you can pass `--seed` with a hex string value:

```sh
rsign generate --seed 12a9e759cb410b4ca3a57a494939704e4bf71a59f01b94ea2740f15d3dc8f9ea
```

Sign `myfile.txt` with your secret key:

```sh
rsign sign myfile.txt
```

You can add a signed trusted comment with:

```sh
rsign sign myfile.txt -t "my trusted comment"
```

If you are signing files larger than 1Gb you must use `-H` to first hash the file and sign the hash after that:

```sh
rsign sign mylargefile.bin -H
```

And to verify the signature with a given public key you can use:

```sh
rsign verify myfile.txt -p rsign.pub
```

Or if you have saved the signature file with a custom name other than `myfile.txt.minisig` and want to use a public key string you can use:

```sh
rsign verify myfile.txt -P [PUBLIC KEY STRING] -x mysignature.file
```

You can export your secret to use it for a Tor Onion v3 hidden service. This will produce `hs_ed25519_secret_key`,
`hs_ed25519_public_key` and `hostname` in the same directory where your `secret key` is.

```sh
rsign export-to-onion-keys
```

and verify a file with onion v3 address:

```sh
rsign verify myfile.txt --onion-address fscst5exmlmr262byztwz4kzhggjlzumvc2ndvgytzoucr2tkgxf7mid.onion
```

You can find more information using the help subcommand as in:

```text
rsign help [SUBCOMMAND]

USAGE:
    rsign [SUBCOMMAND]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    export-to-onion-keys    Convert secret to Tor hidden service keys and hostname
    generate                Generate public and private keys
    help                    Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    sign                    Sign a file with a given private key
    verify                  Verify a signed file with a given public key
```

## Importing keys to Tor hidden service

Previous section describes how to export a secret for usage with Tor v3 onion service
`rsign export-to-onion-keys`. It suffices to copy `hs_ed25519_secret_key` into
your hidden service location, e.g. `var/lib/tor/my_hidden_service/`.

Next, add permission to the `debian-tor` group:

```bash
$ sudo chmod g+r /var/lib/tor/my_hidden_service/hs_ed25519_secret_key
```

Restart Tor:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart tor.service
```

Tor will automatically generate `hs_ed25519_public_key` and `hostname`.
